This is an example to explore an idea to communicate to server components using async generators on Next.js. This will create a tunnel between the two server components that will share data on the server, and can be updated while the UI is streamed to the client.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
